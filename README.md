# **Improving Data Integration Quality for Multi-Source Analytics**

## **Overview**
Data integration from multiple sources is crucial for analytics but comes with challenges like inconsistencies, missing values, and duplication. This project focuses on improving data integration quality through **data validation, conflict resolution, and performance monitoring techniques**. 

The approach includes **building a model for assessing integration quality, deploying it using AWS SageMaker, and developing an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring.**

## **Phase 2: Model Development & Evaluation**
This phase involved designing, training, and evaluating a model to improve data integration quality.

###  Model Development
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant attributes for **error detection and conflict resolution**.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized formats, and removed duplicates.  
- **Conflict Resolution**: Applied rule-based and ML-based techniques to resolve discrepancies.  

### **Model Evaluation**
- **Integration Accuracy**: Measures how well data is merged from multiple sources.  
- **Duplicate Detection Rate**: Assesses the effectiveness of identifying redundant records.  
- **Error Handling Efficiency**: Evaluates how well inconsistencies are managed.

## **Phase 3: Deployment & Performance Analysis**
After validation, the model was deployed and its performance was analyzed.

### **Deployment**
- **Model Deployment**: Converted the trained model into a **REST API** for seamless integration.  
- **Endpoint Management**: Provided **API keys** for controlled access.  

### **Interactive Dashboard for Monitoring**
A **React.js dashboard** was developed for **real-time insights** into data integration quality.

#### **Features**
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Displays **accuracy, duplicate rates, and missing values.**  
- **Conflict Resolution Logs**: Tracks **inconsistencies flagged** by the model.  
- **Custom Data Upload**: Users can **upload datasets** and analyze integration performance.  

### **Resource Utilization Analysis**
- **Compute Power**: Used **4gb vCPUs and 16GB RAM** for training.  
- **Storage Allocation**: **5GB** reserved for logs and model checkpoints.    

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Average Response Time**: **150ms per request**.  
- **Peak Load Handling**: Efficiently processed **high-volume data integration tasks**.
